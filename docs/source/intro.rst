Introduction
============

Most programmers will have their own collection of useful code they'd
like to reuse across projects. This is mine. It follows in spirit with
my `Lisp kutils package <https://github.com/kisom/kutils>`_ and the
`Go analogue <https://github.com/kisom/goutils>`_. Note that these three
libraries don't really have much overlap, and reflect the things I tend
to use each programming language for.
